Welcome to my blog. I guess I can talk about things I'm interested here. Huh.

This blog's made with Jekyll. Jekyll is pretty cool.
<ul class="actions fit">
	<li><a class="button special fit">I can add buttons</a></li>
</ul>

There's that cool contact form at the bottom as well.
It's easy to change settings, I just edit the `footer.html` file if I want to change something. As for making posts or pages, I can use Markdown. Markdown is quite good for editing.

All this is hosted on GitHub pages. That means free hosting for me.

Nice.
