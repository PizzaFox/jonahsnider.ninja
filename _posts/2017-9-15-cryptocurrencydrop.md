What's happening? Panic.
China is shutting down *all* Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges. This has caused a small group of cryptocurrency investors to say
<blockquote>Oh no! I should sell my coins now before they drop too much!</blockquote>
Then more people start selling when the price started going down.
Then more, and more, and more.

Some cryptocurrency investors have predicted this would happen. I think that the prices will go back up soon. In fact, I think that time is now. Bitcoin and Ethereum were dropping around 10% of their value each day. Today they rose by around 10% each. We've hit the bottom of our curve. Now, each day Bitcoin and Ethereum are going to start rising back to their original prices.

This has caused a rush of people buying cryptocurrencies while they're so cheap. Some might hold on to them for a while, some might sell it in two weeks once the price is back to normal. 

Whatever the case is, go buy yourself some cryptocurrencies while they're still *(relatively)* cheap.
