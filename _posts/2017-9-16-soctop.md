You've probably seen an tag on a social media post like <blockquote>#follow4follow</blockquote> or <blockquote>#like4like</blockquote>

The principle of it is simple:
<ol>
	<li>Search for `#like4like` or `#follow4follow`</li>
	<li>Like or follow</li>
	<li>Wait for them to like or follow you back</li>
</ol>

There's a couple problems with this:
<ul>
	<li>Can't guarantee if they will return the favor</li>
	<li>Takes a while to like or follow lots of posts or users</li>
</ul>

There are some apps that help solve these problems, those still need a lot of manual liking and following, though.

<h4>Enter <a href="https://soctop.net/com?t=UhYh6at2">SocTop</a></h4>

<a href="https://soctop.net/com?t=UhYh6at2">SocTop</a> lets you easily earn coins that you can spend on followers, likes, subscribers, etc. for Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, basically anything. You earn these coins by using the <a href="https://soctop.net/com?t=UhYh6at2">SocTop</a> bot or by buying them.

What is the <a href="https://soctop.net/com?t=UhYh6at2">SocTop</a> bot? The <a href="https://soctop.net/com?t=UhYh6at2">SocTop</a> bot is an automated like-for-like system. You simply sign in to your social media accounts for basically everything, click "start earning", and that's it. The bot will automatically like and follow account that other users promote and in return you earn coins. The bot can run silently in the background of your computer without any interaction required by you.

That's it. Three steps and you can get your free Instagram likes or followers

<h4>Installation of the Bot</h4>
<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>Install</h3>
		<p>Install <a href="https://soctop.net/com?t=UhYh6at2">SocTop</a> bot by following the easy-to-follow instructions on your screen;</p>
	</div>
	<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>Run</h3>
		<p>Launch the program and sign in with your account</p>
	</div>
	<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>Add Accounts</h3>
		<p>Add your social media accounts</p>
</div>
<div class="box alt">
	<div class="row 50% uniform">
		<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/bot-downloaded-1.png" alt="" /></span></div>
		<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/bot-downloaded-2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
		<div class="4u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/bot-downloaded-3.png" alt="" /></span></div>
	</div>
</div>

<h4>What Now?</h4>
Once you have the bot set up, you can sit back and relax. If you don't want to use the coins for your own social media accounts you could try selling them. You could sell the free Instagram likes and followers to others who haven't used services like <a href="https://soctop.net/com?t=UhYh6at2">SocTop</a> before. Of course you could always just give these free likes or followers to your friends if they are interested.

Anyways, go make your account
<ul class="actions fit">
	<li><a href="https://soctop.net/com?t=UhYh6at2" class="button special icon fa-external-link">Make an account</a></li>
</ul>
