I've been to New York many times before, never to the city though. I would go to my relative's house in the country, but that's a story for another day.
Here's a bunch of pictures I took during my trip:

The sunset from 25 floors up.

<div class="box alt">
    <div class="row 50% uniform">
      <div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="/assets/images/molecola1.webp" alt=""></span></div>
      <div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="/assets/images/oculus1.webp" alt=""></span></div>
      <div class="4u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="/assets/images/projectfi.webp" alt=""></span></div>
    </div>
</div>

  <li>Mole Cola, now 72% mole! Found in Eataly, a cool Italian market.</li>
  <li>A really cool mall called the Oculus. Lots of glass.</li>
  <li>At the airport Google set up a game. If you answer three geography questions you win a prize like a deck of cards, or a pair of socks. I tried for a <i>very</i> long time to win. I did not succeed.</li>
