I've been to New York many times before, never to the city though. I would go to my relative's house in the country, but that's a story for another day.
Here's a bunch of pictures I took during my trip:

  The sunset from 25 floors up.

  Mole Cola, now 72% mole!
  Found in Eataly, a cool Italian market.

  A really cool mall called the Oculus. Lots of glass.

  At the airport Google set up a game where if you can answer three geography questions you win a prize like a deck of cards, or a pair of socks. I tried for a *very* long time to win. I did not succeed.
